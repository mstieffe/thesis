\chapter{Morphing of Molecular Structures Generated with Top-Down Approaches ???} % Main chapter title

While bottom-up models aim at reproducing thermodynamic and/or structural properties of a yet more detailed system, top-down coarse-grained models are designed to study general phenomenas. As such, it is challenging to relate structures obtained with top-down approaches to a specific chemistry and backmapping such structures to a higher resolution is ill-posed in many cases. However, 

Relating coarse-grained structures obtained with a bottom-up coarse-grained model
