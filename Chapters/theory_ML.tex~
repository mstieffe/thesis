Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is used in a wide range of applications, such as computer vision, speech recognition, drug discovery or medical image analysis. It is a study of computer algorithms that construct statistical models trained to perform some specific task. The models improve their performance automatically by learning from examples instead of relying on static program instructions. Importantly, learning in this context does not mean to memorize examples but to extract patterns or rules from the training data that can also be used to make predictions for data points not present in the training examples. 

Broadly speaking, ML algorithms can be divided into two categories: Supervised and Unsupervised learning. The supervised learning approach uses labeled data, where each input is linked to a desired output. Typical examples of supervised learning are regression or classification tasks. The unsupervised approach deals with unlabeled data, where only the inputs are given, and aims to find structure in the data, like clustering the data points.

ML is an umbrella term for many different algorithms, such as Kernel methods, decision trees or Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), but in this work we will focus on the latter. 


\section{Articial Neural Networks}

The human brain consists of a large number ($\sim 10^{11}$) of interconnected cells, called neurons. While a single neuron is a very simple processing unit, many neurons wired together become a complex neural network with the designation to process information: Signals from the environment captured by sensory cells are encoded and processed by this network to create an appropriate response. 

ANNs are an attempt to built an artificial model of its biological counterpart and are strongly inspired by the visual cortex.
