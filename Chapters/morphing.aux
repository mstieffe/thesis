To this end, an encoder $e_s$ is applied, which reduces the degrees of freedom by a factor $s$, and a backmapping model $g_s$ is trained to reinsert details. Importantly, training of $g_s$ is fixed to the target distribution $\mathcal  {Y}$. Afterwards, the trained model is transferred to $\mathcal  {X}$.
