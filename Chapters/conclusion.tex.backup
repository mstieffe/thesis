\chapter{Conclusion and Future Outlook} 
\label{conclusion} 

This thesis lies at the intersection of multiscale modelling (MM) and machine learning (ML). In the following, the main results of this work are summarized. To this end, 


Understanding molecular processes is central to a wide range of modern research areas. The fundamental principles to describe the motions of microscopic particles are given by quantum-mechanics or Newton's equation of motion. However, the enormous number of microscopic degrees of freedom makes analytical solutions for most molecular systems intractable. To this end, computer simulations of molecular systems are used to study the behavior of the system and to predict its properties. 

The resolution of such computer models is genrally only bound by computational effort. However, while qunatum mechanics provides the most fundamental accurate discription of matter, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations quickly reach their limits. As a remedy, a coarser description of matter is routinely used to push the limits of accessible length and time-scales. In a first step, the resolution of molecular systems can be reduced to the level of single atoms. In this approximation, the effect of electrons is modeled as a potential energy surface representing the quantum ground-state. Such models are routinely implemented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that numerically integrate Newton's equation of motion. The deployed atomic interactions are often empirical and aim at correctly modeling structural, thermodynamic and/or dynamic properties of a target system \cite{mackerell2004empirical}. However, the exploration of many relevant molecular processes, such as protein folding or binding, require to access length and time-scales that are still out of reach for such all-atom models \cite{plattner2015protein, paul2017protein}. To this end, coarse-grained (CG) variables are routinely used that represent an average over atomistic degrees of freedom. Such CG models represent chemical compounds as particles in a similar fashion
to AA MD simulations. The lower resolution of CG systems reduces the computational effort of the simulation and allows for larger integration time steps \cite{marrink2010comment, nielsen2003coarse}. In addition, dynamics of the CG system are typically accelerated due to "softer" interactions between coarse-grained sites \cite{depa2005speed, fritz2011multiscale}. As such, CG models enable a faster exploration of configuration space. 

In general, phenomena of condensed matter can be studied at various levels of resolution. Besi

Phenomena of condensed matter can be studied at various levels of resolution that range from a quantum mechanical description of electronic degrees of freedom to a classical thermodynamic description of macroscopic quantities.



Therefore, it is often necessary to deploy a coarser description of matter in order to push the limits of accessible length and time scales.
