Machine Learning is a subdiscipline in the research field of Artificial Intelligence. It is a study of computer algorithms that construct statistical models trained to perform some specific task. The models improve their performance automatically by learning from examples instead of relying on static program instructions. Importantly, learning in this context does not mean to memorize examples but to extract patterns or rules from the training data than can also be used to make predictions for data points not present in the training examples. 

Broadly speaking, ML algorithms can be divided into two categories: Supervised and Unsupervised learning. The supervised learning approach uses labeled data (each input is linked to a desired output) for regression or classification tasks. The unsupervised approach deals with unlabeled data (only inputs) and aims to find structure in the data, like clustering the data points.
